    "\n",
    "In data science we are almost always going to be connecting to some file or database to get some data. In python code we can access files or other resources by loading in a library that \"knows\" how to communicate with the underlying computer, then asking it to read or write what we want to access. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are libraries written to handle many different types of data in Python such as PDFs, Excel files, and database extracts. The most common thing we'll be using is a CSV - comma separated value - file, a CSV is more or less an Excel table without any formatting or \"smarts\", just the raw data. \n",

    "A key library that we'll use to access data is called Pandas. Pandas provides us with a dataframe, a type of data structure that is basically an internal spreadsheet with rows, columns, and values. Pandas does most of the file access work that we need to do for most purposes, it'll read a file in and convert it to a dataframe data structure, then we can manipulate the dataframe to get the data we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we import the pandas library we'll use the `pd` alias to refer to it. This isn't required, we can not add an alias, or name it anything else we want, but `pd` is the standard and you'll see it pretty universally used. After we load a file into a dataframe we often name that dataframe `df` for the same reason, it's a standard and you'll see it used often. Note that in the file name we normally use a relative path - or instructions on how to find the file relative to the current file. The head() function gives us a little preview of the first 5 rows of the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "df.head()\n",

    "## Dataframes \n",
    "\n",
    "A dataframe is a data structure that is basically a spreadsheet. It has rows, columns, and values. We can access the rows, columns, and values in a dataframe in a variety of ways. Dataframes are the main data structure that we use to do the bulk of our data science work.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Dataframe](../images/df.webp \"Dataframe\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe documentation is located here: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html we want to try to get used to referencing back to the documentation as we encounter things we don't know or are unsure of. Pandas has a lot of functionality and it is expressly made to help make data science stuff easier, so if we want to do something with our data, checking to see what Pandas can already do for us is a good first step. A good habit to try for the near future is to refer back to the pandas documentation if you know you need to do something, and see if you can find a function that does what you need. Despite some likely frustration at first, this is something that you'll commonly need to do if you are actually programming, and the skill of deciphering documentation is something that comes with experience. Some examples of things that you might want to look into are which values occur in a column, how many times they occur, are there any blanks, what's the largest/smallest, how large is the dataset, etc... When things like this come up, attempt to figure it out from the documentation first, then Google an example, then ask for help if you still can't figure it out."

    "Just like a spreadsheet, the dataframe values can be accessed by row and column. We can use the `iloc` function to access the values by row and column number, or the `loc` function to access the values by row and column name. Note that the `iloc` function is zero based, so the first row is row 0, the second row is row 1, etc. The `loc` function is one based, so the first row is row 1, the second row is row 2, etc. The order of the rows in our dataframe is both critical and irrelevant - the data generally isn't in any particular order, so something being in row 1 or row 1,000,000 makes no difference; at the same time, when we do machine learning work later, we normally trust that the order is fixed, so row 1 is always row 1, and row 1,000,000 is always row 1,000,000. \n",

    "<b>Note:</b> we <i>can</i> address things by their coordinates in the dataframe, but it isn't often something we really want to do. We won't spend a lot of time or effort dealing with the data in this way, but it's good to know that it's possible. The pandas documentation with details and examples is here: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/indexing.html"

    "## Slicing Dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "Much more often than accessing a single value in a dataframe we'll want to access a subset of the dataframe. We can do this by slicing the dataframe, or selecting a subset of the rows and columns. We can slice a dataframe by row, by column, or by both.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Column Name and Conditional Addressing\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often when we are selecting parts of a dataframe we'll do so using the column names for selecting columns or some condition for selecting rows. The syntax for this is follows a pattern (the final example is not common, the first 4 are):\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> df[ 'column_name' ] - select a single column by name </li>\n",
    "<li> df[[ 'column_name_1', 'column_name_2' ]] - select multiple columns by name </li>\n",
    "<li> df[df[ 'column_name'] == 'some_value' ] - select rows where the value in a column is equal to some value </li>\n",
    "<li> df[df[ 'column_name'] > 100] - select rows where the value in a column is greater than some value </li>\n",
    "<li> df[df[ 'column_name'].isin(['value_1', 'value_2'] )] - select rows where the value in a column is equal to one of a list of values </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's some sample code to select a column, code to filter based on some value, and a combination:\n",
    "    \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n",
    "    # Get a column\n",
    "    first_name = df['first_name']\n",
    "    # Get several columns\n",
    "    names = df[['first_name', 'last_name']]\n",
    "    # Filter by value\n",
    "    df_filtered = df[ df[\"income\"] > 100000 ]\n",
    "    # Get a column from a filtered dataframe\n",
    "    df_filtered_names = df_filtered[ ['first_name', 'last_name'] ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loc and Iloc\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the `loc` and `iloc` functions to select rows and columns. The `loc` function selects rows and columns by name, the `iloc` function selects rows and columns by number. These are sometimes needed, but they don't come up all that often for us - so you'll need to be aware of them, and able to read or understand them given a little time to look it up, but you don't need to memorize them. A table showing some examples is here:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Loc and Iloc](../images/loc_iloc.png \"Loc and Iloc\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The `loc` function is inclusive of the last value, the `iloc` function is exclusive of the last value. This is a common source of confusion, so it's worth noting.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note: Please do not get overly stressed or worried about all the different ways to slice data out of a dataframe. The vast majority of times that we need to slice or select from a dataframe, it will be done by either just naming a column, or specifying a filter condition. The iloc, loc, and more elaborate stuff is less common, and it is something that we can always just look up if needed - as long as you understand, in English, what you need to select, it is easy to look up exactly what command is needed to do so. Seriously, this looks more daunting than it is.</b>"

    "As in Excel, we can group data in a dataframe and then perform some aggregation on the grouped data. The syntax for this is:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "<b>Note:</b> if we are grouping, we need to perform some aggregation, or it doesn't make sense. We can group by a column and then count the number of rows in each group, or we can group by a column and then sum the values in another column, but we can't group by a column and then just show the values in another column - value would be shown? The first? The last? The average? The sum? The max? The min? It doesn't make sense to group by a column and then show the values in another column without some aggregation. We can provide the aggregation functions as a dictionary, and whatever is in there will be calculated. Each key/value pair is the name of the column, along with the calculation we want. "

    "### Looping Through a Dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "We can loop through a dataframe by row, or by column. We can also loop through a dataframe by row and column. There are several ways to do this, the most direct being using the iterrows() function in a for loop, the syntax for this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    for index, row in df.iterrows(): # loop through the dataframe by row\n",
    "        print( row ) # print the row\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, slghtly more complicated, we can loop through the dataframe by row and column, the syntax for this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    for index, row in df.iterrows(): # loop through the dataframe by row\n",
    "        for column in df.columns: # loop through the dataframe by column\n",
    "            print( row[column] ) # print the value in a column for each row\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterrows() function iterates through the rows of the dataframe, and in each iteration of the loop it provides two values - the index of that row, and the row itself as an object. Each row that is returned can be used as though it is a one row dataframe - we can use column names to grab specific values. Note that this can be slow for large dataframes, there are alternate methods to do many of the things we'd want to loop for, but more expediently. "

    "#### Pandas and Other Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV filetype is by far the most commonly used for small scale data science work, but we do commonly use other file types. Pandas itself is pretty capable and can handle lots of similar file types, most notably Excel files. The Panda's documentation has a list of the file types it can handle here: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html One thing to note is that it can usually handle zipped files without us having to unzip them first, so if you have larger CSV datasets that are zipped, you can use them in their compressed state. CSV datasets tend to compress very well, so this can save a lot of space, and if you're using GitHub or some other repository to store code, this can help you from going over size limits. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas read functions also provide several arguments that are occasionally used, here we specify that the first row of the file is a header row in the Excel file. There are others for selecting a sheet, or the encoding of the data. These details are normally only needed if our file doesn't load correctly, pandas is good at figuring out most common things, but if it doesn't load properly (and you know the file itself is ok), then it is fairly likely that we need to provide some additional argument to tell pandas how to understand the file. Most times when this happens, Googling the error will give one or two things like this to try, I've personally never had those recommendations not work. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:<b> in most production environments we will probably use a connection to a database rather than load a file. The concepts are almost identical, we'd just replace the \"read_csv\" part that we used here with a similar command(s) to grab the desired data from the database. With larger scale examples such as neural networks, that still holds - rather than making datasets from the data in our file, we would make them from our database connection. Once we have the data in our program, it doesn't matter where it came from. In fact, we can replace the \"load some data\" part of most of the code we write with some other chunk of code that loads the data from somewhere else, and the rest of the code will work the same."

One thing that this is useful for is if we are doing something that involves a lot of data manipulation, we can write our code to do our data manipulation, save the output, then we don't need to redo it to use the data. This starts to become important when we have a lot of data and data manipulation takes a long time - we don't want to spend 5 hours waiting for our program to run and clean up our data every time we want to do something with it."

    "Interacting with the underlying computer is explicitly not really a huge focus for what we need to do in data science, but it's good to know that it's possible, and it is sometimes critical. Calls like this to interact with the computer are much more common in other types of programming, such as if you were making an application with a UI. In data science we are mainly focused on just grabbing some data, then we do all of our work inside our program, so we don't need to interact with the computer much. This also has the advantage of making our programs fairly portable, as we'll see later when we use Colab to run our code in the cloud."

The `!` at the beginning of the command tells the notebook that this is a magic command, and not a normal Python command. The `pip` command is the Python package manager, which is a program that knows how to download and install Python libraries. The `install` command is the command that tells pip to install something. The `pandas` part is the name of the library that we want to install.\n",

What this magic command can do for us is to help make it easy to run our code anywhere, such as Colab on the cloud. If we install the libraries we need from within our notebook, then we can run the notebook anywhere and it will have everything it needs to run. For the most part, the things we use in data science are pretty common, so it is unlikely that we'll try to install anything that can't be found."
