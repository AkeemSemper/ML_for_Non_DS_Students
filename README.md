# Machine Learning in Python for non-Analysts

Repository for materials and workbooks for learning about machine learning in Python for non-analysts.

This repository contains the bulk of the exercises and in-class materials for the course.

## Parts of this Repository

There are several sections of this repository that you will likely need to pay attention to:

<ul>
<li> Class Workbooks - this is the main folder, containing the workbooks that we'll go through each class for demonstrations and exercises. </li>
<li> Supplementary Practice Workbooks - this contains additional workbooks that you can use to practice your skills. They are generally relatively simple compared to the exrecises that we will do in the other workbooks. </li>
<li> Course Resources - this will contain non-workbook resources, like PowerPoint slides and other materials. </li>
</ul>

## Using this Repository

The main usage of this repository will be for you to open the relevant workbook in Colab and work on it in class. You can also save a copy of changes that you've made back to your own Google Drive or GitHub repository.

Using GitHub is extremely common, so getting used to it here is a good experience. One of the main features is that updates will be made automatically - as we go through the semester, I'll add and change some of the files depending on how the course is going, if we need more practice somewhere, or if we need to add something in for depth. Those changes are synched to this repository, so you can get used to checking for updates. 

There is a small bit of frustration in learning to deal with GitHub, but it is worth it.
